1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack - LIFO**
   - **Queue - FIFO**

2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?
   - **Linked List - O(n) **
   - **Hash Table - N/A **
   - **Binary Search Trees - O(n)**

2. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?
    - If we know the key, hashtable takes _constant_ time to find the destination for a key and place a value there.

    - **Search** and **delete** time complexity is _O(1)_ in Hash table and its _O(n)_ for Arrays.
